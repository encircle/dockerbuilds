# NGINX Static

This readme is for the encircle nginx-static image.

The image uses encircle/nginx-modsec:latest as the base image and simply replaces the default.conf with
a new version for static content serving (the standard nginx-modsec is a PHP FPM enabled site).

## Environment Variables

Same as encircle/nginx-modsec
